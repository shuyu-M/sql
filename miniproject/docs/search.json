    "text": "The Delay Spectrum: Not All Airlines Are Equal\n\nMaximum Delay Exposure\nWhen flights go wrong, how wrong can they go? Our analysis reveals stark differences in how airlines handle their worst-case scenarios.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\n# Load data\ndelays_max = pd.read_csv('Miniproject_problem1_Shuyu_Meng_sm4094.csv')\nearly_dep = pd.read_csv('Miniproject_problem2_Shuyu_Meng_sm4094.csv')\n\n# Convert delays to hours for better readability\ndelays_max['max_delay_hours'] = delays_max['max_dep_delay'] / 60\n\n# Create bar chart\nfig = px.bar(delays_max.sort_values('max_dep_delay'), \n             x='max_delay_hours', \n             y='Airline_Name',\n             orientation='h',\n             title='Maximum Departure Delay by Airline (Hours)',\n             labels={'max_delay_hours': 'Maximum Delay (hours)', 'Airline_Name': ''},\n             color='max_delay_hours',\n             color_continuous_scale='Reds')\n\nfig.update_layout(height=500, showlegend=False)\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\nWhat This Means\nThe gap between best and worst performers is dramatic. Alaska Airlines experienced a maximum delay of just 8.6 hours, while American Airlines had flights delayed over 28 hours—more than an entire day.\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean American is “worse”—larger airlines with more flights and routes face more opportunities for extreme delays. However, it does raise questions about operational recovery procedures and how airlines handle severe disruptions.\nWhy It Matters: Passengers on certain carriers face significantly higher risk of catastrophic delays. This affects not just travel plans, but hotel bookings, missed connections, and business commitments.\n\n\n\nThe Early Bird Phenomenon\nInterestingly, some airlines also depart significantly early—up to 46 minutes ahead of schedule.\n\n\nCode\n# Convert to positive numbers and minutes for clarity\nearly_dep['minutes_early'] = abs(early_dep['max_early_departure'])\n\nfig = px.bar(early_dep.sort_values('max_early_departure', ascending=True), \n             x='minutes_early', \n             y='Airline_Name',\n             orientation='h',\n             title='Maximum Early Departure by Airline (Minutes)',\n             labels={'minutes_early': 'Minutes Ahead of Schedule', 'Airline_Name': ''},\n             color='minutes_early',\n             color_continuous_scale='Greens')\n\nfig.update_layout(height=500, showlegend=False)\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\nThe Double-Edged Sword of Early Departures\nWhile departing early might seem like efficient operations, it creates problems. SkyWest Airlines departed up to 46 minutes early in some cases. This can leave connecting passengers stranded or force travelers to arrive at airports earlier than necessary.\nAirlines walk a fine line: depart too late and customers complain about delays; depart too early and you risk leaving passengers behind."

Friday sees 59% more flights than Saturday, and the mid-week period (Wednesday through Friday) accounts for over 50% of all flights.\nWhy This Pattern Exists: - Business travel peaks mid-week to Friday as professionals travel for meetings and return home - Weekend leisure travel favors Friday departures and Sunday returns - Saturday becomes the “recovery day” for airlines to perform maintenance and reposition aircraft\nOperational Impact: Airlines must staff heavily mid-week and can scale back on weekends. This creates efficiency opportunities but also challenges in maintaining consistent service levels."

    "section": "Conclusion: What We Learned and Why It Matters",
    "text": "Conclusion: What We Learned and Why It Matters\nThis analysis of over 600,000 flights from May 2019 reveals that airline performance is far more nuanced than simple “on-time” metrics suggest. Here’s what matters:\n\n1. Context Shapes Performance\nAirline and airport rankings depend heavily on context. A small regional carrier serving challenging airports will have different metrics than a major hub-based airline. Regional airports like CMX face structural challenges that pure operational excellence can’t overcome.\n\n\n2. Patterns Are Predictable\nWhether it’s the Friday flight rush, weekend capacity dips, or weather-driven cancellations at specific airports, most disruptions follow patterns. This predictability creates opportunities for: - Better passenger communication and expectations - Strategic scheduling and resource allocation - Proactive rather than reactive operations\n\n\n3. Different Problems Need Different Solutions\nOur analysis identified three distinct problem categories: - Delay management: Varies by airline operational procedures and recovery capabilities - Cancellation causes: Split between unavoidable (weather) and manageable (carrier, system) factors\n- Capacity planning: Driven by predictable weekly demand patterns\nEach requires tailored interventions rather than one-size-fits-all solutions.\n\n\n4. The Human Impact\nBehind these statistics are real travelers: business people missing meetings, families disrupted during vacations, and critical trips derailed. The 13,012 canceled flights in just one month affected roughly 1-2 million passengers.\n\n\nLooking Forward\nUnderstanding these patterns empowers stakeholders: - Travelers can make informed choices about airlines, routes, and travel timing - Airlines can target specific operational bottlenecks with data-driven interventions - Airports can invest in infrastructure where it matters most - Policymakers can identify systematic issues requiring regulatory attention\nAviation remains a remarkable achievement—moving millions safely across continents daily. But there’s always room for improvement, and data shows us where to focus our efforts.\n\n\n\nData Sources & Methodology\n\nData: U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics\nTime Period: May 2019 (31 days)\nFlight Count: 636,390 domestic flights\nAirlines: 17 major and regional carriers\nAirports: 300+ departure airports analyzed\n\nAll SQL queries and source code available in the project repository."
